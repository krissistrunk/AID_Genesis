## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Phase 0: ConceptCraft AI
```python
# Collaborative concept development
concept_document = await conceptcraft.develop_concept(
    initial_idea="AI-powered customer support",
    stakeholder_complexity="enterprise",
    innovation_mode=True
)
```

### Phase 1: Story-Enhanced PRD Generation
```python
# Transform stories into technical requirements
prd = await story_engine.generate_prd(
    concept_document=concept_document,
    technical_complexity="moderate",
    validation_requirements="enterprise"
)
```

### Phase 2: Adaptive Development Orchestration
```python
# Choose optimal development approach
approach = await adaptive_intelligence.determine_approach(
    prd_complexity=prd.complexity_score,
    stakeholder_count=len(concept_document.stakeholders),
    confidence_requirements=0.92
)
```

### Phase 3: Unified Validation & Deployment
```python
# Multi-layer validation with story alignment
validation_result = await unified_validation.validate(
    implementation=generated_code,
    original_stories=concept_document.core_stories,
    confidence_threshold=0.92
)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Install AID Commander Genesis
pip install aid-commander-genesis
